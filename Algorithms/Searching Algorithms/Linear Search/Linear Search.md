# Linear Search

Linar search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end an goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.

## What is Linear Search?

**Linear Search** is a method of searching an element in a collection of elements. In Linear Search, each element, of the collection is visited one by one in a sequential fashion to find the desired element. Linear Search is also known as **Sequential Search**.

## Algorithm for Linear Search

The algorith for linear search can be broken down into the following steps:

- Start: Begin at the first element of the collection of elements.
- Compare: Compare the current element with the desired element.
- Found: If the current element is equal to the desired element, return true or index to the current element.
- Move: Othewise, move to the next element in the collection.
- Repeat: Repeat steps 2-4 until we have reached the end of the collection.
- Not found: If the end of the collection is reached without finding the desired element, return that the desired element is not in the collection.
